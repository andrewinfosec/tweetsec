### tweetsec security toolset: Classic computer security tools in < 140 characters

By Andrew Stewart ([https://andrewinfosec.com](https://andrewinfosec.com))

Contains:

+ TCP port scanner
+ Unix password cracker (dictionary-based)
+ Password sniffer for plaintext TCP protocols e.g. Telnet

NB: these tools are not practical for performing real-world security auditing.  The purpose of this exercise is simply to obtain an uber-minimalist implementation of each type of tool, and to enjoy the coding challenge imposed by the 140 character limit.

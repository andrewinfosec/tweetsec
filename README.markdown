### tweetsec security toolset: classic computer security tools in < 140 characters ###

By andrewinfosec@gmail.com

Contains:

+ TCP port scanner.
+ Unix password cracker (dictionary-based).
+ Password sniffer for plaintext TCP protocols e.g. Telnet.

NB: these tools are not practical for performing real-world security auditing.  The purpose of this exercise is simply to obtain an uber-minimalist implementation of each type of tool.  It's also to enjoy the coding challenge imposed by the 140 character limit.
